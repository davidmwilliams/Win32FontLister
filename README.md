# Win32 Font Lister

A Windows desktop app to display samples from all fonts available, including uninstalled fonts from a specified device or location.

# History

Win32 Font Lister is an app I wrote in Delphi in 1998, and updated several times to 2003. The inspiration came when two people unrelatedly asked me in the same week if I knew of any good apps to help them print a sample of all their installed fonts.

I released it as shareware for $5. It was quite fun to get a cheque periodically, though I soon moved to various shareware sales portals.

I enjoyed receiving feedback saying my app was more aesthetic and intuitive than offerings by Adobe and Microsoft, and I also was pleased to offer the ability to display samples of uninstalled fonts, as well as installed fonts. This took some clever trickery to achieve.

In the early 2000's I moved away from Delphi to .NET, but came into Delphi again in 2014 and was delighted to see my code still opened and compiled fine. Though, I depended on QuickReports which came with earlier versions of Delphi but no longer with later versions so this could be a problem. I also originally used some commercial third-party components like TOrpheus which were no longer available for sale, but happily had released their code as open source.

In 1998 it was a big thing to call an app "Win32" indicating it was 32-bit, unlike the 16-bit apps that existed prior to Windows '95 and were still quite prevalent. As years progressed people would ask me "What's Win32 mean?" and it does, now, seem an odd naming choice. Still, the app is a symptom of its time.

Hopefully you find this interesting, and I hope my Delphi formatting style appeals.
